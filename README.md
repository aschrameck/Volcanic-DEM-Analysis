## Project Overview

This project automates the analysis of cinder cone digital elevation models (DEMs) to quantify volcanic landform morphology and perform cluster analysis on extracted features. The workflow integrates Python for DEM processing and R for statistical clustering.

Key objectives include:

* Automatically segmenting cinder cone DEMs.
* Extracting cone and crater measurements such as width, elevation, basal elevation, rim height, ellipticity, elongation, circularity, orientation, area, and crater depth.
* Performing cluster analysis in R to identify patterns and classify volcanic landforms.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x** (with `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` installed)
* **R** (with `cluster`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr` installed)
* **ArcGIS Pro** (for ArcPy if using DEM processing within ArcGIS)
* Optional: IDEs like VSCode, PyCharm, or RStudio for running scripts

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aschrameck/Volcanic-DEM-Analysis.git
cd Volcanic-DEM-Analysis
```

### Step 2: Set Up Python Environment

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

2. Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
# ArcPy comes with ArcGIS Pro if needed
```

### Step 3: Running Python Scripts

Currently, the repository contains two Python scripts:

* `segment.py` – Generic DEM segmentation functions.
* `radial-segment.py` – Functions for radial segmentation and measurement extraction.

### Step 4: Cluster Analysis in R

* Future analysis in R will load measurements generated by Python scripts and perform clustering (k-means, hierarchical) to group volcanic landforms by morphology.
